# Stock-price

Here’s a step-by-step implementation of a Stock Price Prediction Model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTMs in Python.


---

Step 1: Import Required Libraries

---

Step 2: Load and Preprocess Data

Load stock price data (e.g., from a CSV file) and preprocess it.

---

Step 3: Prepare the Dataset for LSTM

LSTMs require sequential data. We split the data into sequences (e.g., past 60 days of prices to predict the next day’s price).


---

Step 4: Split Data into Training and Test Sets


---

Step 5: Build the LSTM Model

Build a sequential model with LSTM layers, dropout layers, and dense layers.


---

Step 6: Train the Model

Train the model using the training data.

---

Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model on test data and visualize the performance.


---

Step 8: Predict Future Stock Prices

Predict future prices using the last sequence_length days from the test set.

Explanation of Steps

1. Data Scaling

LSTMs work better with normalized data. MinMaxScaler scales the data to a range of [0, 1], making it suitable for LSTM processing.

2. Sequential Data Preparation

For each point in the dataset, the past n days of data are used to predict the next value. This sequence-based approach captures temporal dependencies.


3. LSTM Model

LSTM Layers: Capture temporal patterns and relationships in sequential data.

Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly disabling some neurons.

Dense Layer: Outputs the predicted stock price for the next day.


4. Training

The model is trained using the training data, minimizing the error (mean squared error) using the Adam optimizer.

5. Testing and Evaluation

Predicted values are compared against actual values to evaluate the model's performance.

Visualization helps identify how well the model predicts trends.

This pipeline can be fine-tuned (e.g., adjusting the number of LSTM layers, dropout rates, or epochs) to achieve better results for your specific dataset.
